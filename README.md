<h1>The Birthday Problem</h1>
Today at JobTrain we found out the probability of a shared birthday in a room of 30 people, for example. </br>
Using Python, we created a virtual "room" (a list) of people with random birthdays (numbers between 1 and </br>
365. We checked whether any numbers were repeated in the list. That's one trial.</br>
Using more trials, like 60,000 of them, we found out the probability: around 70%.
